# Skinport Flipping Stats
Website to view a list of your skinport transactions & the price you sold them for after (in case you also sold them on skinport).
You can find a live demo of the page [here](https://skinport-flip-stats.onrender.com/) (It might take a bit to load as it is hosted on a free tier and only gets "woken up" once people open the site)

# How to set up
Requires nodejs to be installed.
Run `npm install` in the workspace to get the packages installed & run it with `node server.js`.
Finally, you can access it through http://localhost:3000 (or any port defined as "PORT" in the environment).

# How to use
Enter your Client-ID and API-Key from skinport to the site and click the "Refresh info" button. 
The pair can be found on https://skinport.com/en/account:
